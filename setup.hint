sdesc: "Converts BibTeX into XHTML"
ldesc: "bib2xhtml is a program that converts BibTeX files into HTML 
(specifically XHTML 1.0). The conversion is mostly done by specialized 
BibTeX style files, derived from a converted bibliography style 
template. This ensures that the original BibTeX styles are faithfully 
reproduced. Some postprocessing is performed by Perl code."
